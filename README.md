# Check available seats for courses at Boston University

## Description

At Boston University, (or any university), it is relevant and important to be able to easily check for how many seats are left for a course that you are interested in. Using a back-end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>  script that I wrote, it is possible to scrape and parse the contents of a specified search query, and to locate the appropriate tag containing the number of seats left. This output is then transferred to a user-friendly app. I wrote the front-end in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK">GTK</a> API, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glade_Interface_Designer">Glade UI-designer</a>.

## Usage example

The below images illustrate how the app works:
